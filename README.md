## Description
This is my portfolio as part of the MITxPro FullStack Certificate Program with MERN. The site serves as practice in building a basic website through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, several small projects are featured to demonstrate some of my learning thus far. 

Bootstrap was used to create a responsive and mobile friendly website.

## Future Enhancements
I will continue to build and refine the site as my skills develop. More projects will be featured and existing ones may also be refined and updated.
